And now for something completely different: how to magnetize a Cyriss Heavy Vector kit for all three options: Cipher, Inverter and Monitor.

<!-- more -->

## Magnetize everything!

I used magnets in the following sizes:

* Fifteen 2mm round magnets (1mm thick)
* Three 1/8" round magnets
* A long round magnet as "guide" for the other magnets -- it really helps but is not required.

*Note:* I took all these pictures after already done magnetizing and assembling the whole thing. You'll find it easier to magnetize certain parts before gluing them into place.


## The guide magnet

As you can see in this picture, a guide magnet makes it easy to keep track of the polarity of your magnets. After sticking one magnet in the hole on the torso, I put the guide magnet on that magnet. Then remove the magnet and put a 2mm magnet on that side of the guide magnet -- it will match the polarity of the first magnet in the torso.

I also use it to get the right polarity for the arms I'll stick to the torso. Put the guide magnet on the torso, and then a 2mm magnet on the end of it, like in this picture. Then remove the guide magnet, and use that to stick the 2mm magnet in the upper arm.


## Magnetizing the left shoulder

The shoulders are the bits that attach straight to the main body. The left one can be glued on, but the right one will need to be magnetized for all the weapon options. More on that later.

The left shoulder has a bit that slots into it with a ball joint on the end. Shave the ball joint off and sand it smooth, then drill a hole in he center of it for a 2mm magnet. Then you can glue it to the left shoulder, and glue the left shoulder to the body.

## Magnetizing the left arms

I chose to use 1/8" magnets here, they're just the right width and thickness to glue them straight into the ball socket without having to do anything else.

These tend to rotate a bit -- I'm going add a very thin layer of greenstuff on top of the magnets to give them some more friction.

## Magnetizing the right piston spike

You can glue the shoulder joint into the right piston spike; it's not used for the other arms on the right side. Then drill a hole in the center of it on each side for magnets. I had to sand it down a fair bit before it fit into the shoulder socket.

We're doing this before we magnetize the right shoulder so we can use it as a reference for the polarity -- you really don't want to get it wrong.

## Magnetizing the right shoulder

Here's where you'll need a bit more precision. Drill a hole in the center of the socket for a magnet, and then another one in the small screw feature just in front of it.

The magnets I use are strong enough to keep the arm in place with just the one magnet in the socket, but I put another one in to keep the arm stable without dipping down due to the center of gravity.

But we're not done yet. Using the "screws" at the front and back as a guide, drill a hole straight through into the inside of the slot for the arm. Put two magnets on the inside of the sockets, but don't glue them until you've tried putting the piston spike in there to double-check that the polarity is correct. If it's wrong, you can pop the magnet out with a needle. Then you can just pour some glue in from the open side to keep the magnets in place.

I'll cover the holes up with greenstuff later.

Now you can put the right piston spike arm in the shoulder and it'll stick there.

After that, drill corresponding holes in the torso. One in the center of the joint. You'll have to eyeball where the second magnet will go since there's no handy feature to aim at.

## Magnetizing the remaining arms

The macropummeler is easy -- just repeat what you did for the piston spike. I decided to put the magnets here a bit off-center so the arm is tilted away from the body instead of held straight.

The ellipsaw flinger is a repeat of the magnetized shoulder bit.

## Magnetizing the head

Very straightforward. Drill a hole in the joint and socket, stick magnets there.

## Done!

And that's one heavy Vector fully magnetized. Repeat the appropriate parts for the Cipher in the battlegroup box and you can field any two of a Monitor, an Inverter or two Ciphers.
