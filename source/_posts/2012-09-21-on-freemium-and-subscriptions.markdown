It's an interesting era for games right now. The [Free To Play][f2p] (F2P) and [Freemium][freemium] payment models have finally gained enough traction and now some of the big names in publishing are willing to try it out -- and some of them are _forced_ to.

## Guild Wars ##

[Guild Wars 2][gw2] was released less than a month ago, and I haven't played it in over a week.

What I _don't_ play bears mention here because of its business model. Guild Wars 2, just like the first game, went for a model where you buy the game, and then you can play it as much as you want with no additional costs or fees.

That sounds like every game ever, but the first Guild Wars took a big risk when it launched in 2005. It was an online-only game, and online games tend to have high maintenance and upkeep costs, which is why many MMOs are subscription-based in the first place.

The first Guild Wars was a pretty special game, mechanics-wise -- it had central non-combat hubs which were where you actually met your fellow players, but when you left those areas you were limited to a party of up to eight, and you had your own instance of the outside world.

Guild Wars 2 has a more traditional MMO approach with one shared world for everybody, divided into servers. And it's very interesting to see a more traditional MMO choose to _not_ be subscription-based.

As mentioned, I haven't really played Guild Wars 2 lately. It's been busy; I had other things to get done.

And I feel absolutely no stress at all! I know that there is no subscription fee ticking away while I'm not playing. I remember several periods back when I played World of Warcraft where I felt some strange _obligation_ to play even if I didn't really want to, because I had paid for the subscription fee. And of course I had no fun doing so.

I can _not_ play Guild Wars 2 if I choose to, and there's a strange sense of liberation with the lack of subscription fee.

## In this economy

[ANet][anet] has to make money on the game though, and that's where the business model kicks in. And it's a quite excellent business model, both for ANet as a company and for me as an actual player of the game.

The in-game currency is, as is traditional, gold, with its silver and copper denominations. On top of that, there's a currency that consists of gems.

You can buy [gems](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem) from other players with your gold, but these gems are a limited resource. Gold is created out of thin air when you whack a centaur (where they keep their gold is a mental exercise left to the reader), but gems are only added to the economy when a player actually pays real-world money for them.

In a sense, they cut the eternal MMO scourge of gold farmers/sellers/spammers (pick one) out of the loop by selling the gold themselves. Suddenly you have a game where the creators accept real money for gems, and you can sell these gems on to other players in return for gold!

Gems have a fixed real-money value of €0.80 per 100 gems. The gem-to-gold exchange rate fluctuates depending on how many gems are currently for sale in the system, as per basic supply and demand rules.

I'm sure the gold sellers will adapt to this model eventually, but right now it's hilarious to see them offer a whopping _two_ gold for ten dollars.

Of course, gems have no value if you can't use them for anything. ANet wrote [an interesting blog post](http://www.arena.net/blog/mike-obrien-on-microtransactions-in-guild-wars-2) about their whole philosophy for microtransactions:

{% blockquote Mike O'Brien http://www.arena.net/blog/mike-obrien-on-microtransactions-in-guild-wars-2 Microtransactions in Guild Wars 2 %}
We think players should have the opportunity to spend money on items that provide visual distinction and offer more ways to express themselves. They should also be able to spend money on account services and on time-saving convenience items. But it’s never OK for players to buy a game and not be able to enjoy what they paid for without additional purchases, and it’s <em>never OK</em> for players who spend money to have an unfair advantage over players who spend time.
