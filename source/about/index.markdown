{% img left /images/blog/mugshot.png 128 128 %} Hello. I'm **Johan Svensson** and this is my hidey-hole on the internet.

Here I tend to write about various nerdy subjects, including programming, design and various kinds of gaming, both digital and analog.

I live in Stockholm, Sweden, with my cat April, who is annoyed at the number of pictures I take of her.
