{% img right /images/blog/mugshot.png 128 128 %} Hello. I'm **Johan Svensson** and this is my hidey-hole on the internet.

Here I tend to write about various nerdy subjects, including programming, design and various kinds of gaming, both digital and analog.

I live in Stockholm, Sweden, with my cat April, who is annoyed at the number of pictures I take of her.

## Contact ##

My email is _myfirstname @ this domain_. Consider this a puzzle.

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/echo) and [GitHub](https://github.com/jsvensson).

## Comment policy ##

My comment policy is, at the moment, quite simply _no comments_.

I may or may not change my mind in the future. But as it stands right now, I find comments mostly annoying. Most of the time it's either spam or something that contributes absolutely nothing at all.

I do however encourage people to write responses on their own blog. I'll spot them if they link me.
