Hello. I'm **Johan Svensson** and this is my hidey-hole on the internet.

Here I tend to write about various nerdy subjects, including programming, design and various kinds of gaming, both digital and analog.

I live in Stockholm, Sweden, with my cat April, who is annoyed at the number of pictures I take of her.

## Atomic Whatnow?

Eh, just a phrase that I heard in the early 90s and has been firmly stuck in my mind ever since.

"I am not an atomic playboy" is a phrase uttered by [Vice Admiral William H. P. Blandy][admiral] while he was overseeing the [Bikini Atoll][bikiniatoll] atomic bomb tests. The full quote goes:

> The bomb will not start a chain-reaction in the water converting it all to gas and letting all the ships on all the oceans drop down to the bottom. It will not blow out the bottom of the sea and let all the water run down the hole. It will not destroy gravity. I am not an atomic playboy, as one of my critics labeled me, exploding these bombs to satisfy my personal whim.

## Comment Policy

I reserve the right to delete any comment for no reason whatsoever.

I may or may not change my mind in the future. But as it stands right now, I find comments mostly annoying. Most of the time it's either spam or something that contributes absolutely nothing at all, but I still need to either answer or delete it -- leaving it unanswered isn't an option for me.

I do however encourage people to write responses on their own blog. I'll spot them if they link me.
